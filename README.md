The Dual-Order Framework: A Unified Scientific Model for Physical and Relational Resilience

This repository contains the official scientific validation and supplemental materials for the Dual-Order Framework, a unified model designed to measure and understand both physical and relational resilience.

The Dual-Order Framework distinguishes between two fundamental components:

LP (Low-Probability / Position-based factors): Structural or contextual elements that define possibilities — like the chessboard and positions in a game.

LR (Law-Rule / Relational dynamics): Governing principles and rules that determine how interactions unfold.

Human agency acts as the variable that drives outcomes, similar to player decisions in a chess match.

This model offers a quantitative and relational approach for researchers and practitioners working in systems science, public health, environmental resilience, and complexity theory.
